prompt_structure,"Objective:  Parse a text-formatted resume efficiently and extract diverse applicant's data into a structured JSON format that adheres to the provided TypeScript interface schema.

Input: Text-formatted applicant's resume.

Steps:
1. Analyze Structure: Examine the text-formatted resume to understand its organization and identify key sections (e.g., education, experience, skills).
2. Convert to JSON: Map the extracted information to the corresponding fields in the schema, creating a structured JSON representation.
3. Optimize Output: Ensure the JSON is well-formatted, error-free, and handles missing values appropriately.
4. Handle Variations: Account for different resume styles and formatting to accurately extract relevant data.

Consider following TypeScript Interface for JSON schema:
```
interface Media {
  linkedin: string;
  github: string;
  devpost: string;
  medium: string;
  leetcode: string;
  dagshub: string;
  kaggle: string;
  instagram: string;
}

interface Education {
  degree: string;
  university: string;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  grade?: string;
  coursework?: string[];
}

interface SkillSection {
  name: string;
  skills: string[];
}

interface Work {
  role: string;
  company: string;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  description: string[];
}

interface Project {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  link?: string;
  from: string;
  to: string;
  description: string[];
}

interface Certification {
  name: string;
  by: string;
  link: string;
}

interface Achievements {
  [index: number]: string;
}

interface RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA {
  name: string;
  summary: string;
  phone: string;
  email: string;
  media: Media;
  education: Education[];
  skill_section: SkillSection[];
  work_experience: Work[];
  projects: Project[];
  certifications: Certification[];
  achievements: Achievements;
}
```

Desired Output: Write the Well-formatted JSON adhering to the RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA schema, handling missing values with empty strings or ""None"".
<JSON_OUTPUT_ACCORDING_TO_RESUME_DATA_SCHEMA>

The results should contain valid JSON only, without any delimiter or characters making invalid JSON format."
