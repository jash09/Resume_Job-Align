About the job
Title: AI/ML Data Science Intern

This internship is with the Marketing Data Sciences team at HP Inc. This individual will be responsible for helping the team to shape its AI/ML strategy, specifically through the creation of AI models, such as Large Language models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), for Marketing.
