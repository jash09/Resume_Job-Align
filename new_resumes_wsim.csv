**Candidate Name:** Tushar Singh

**Job Title:** Viasat Control Systems Intern

**Overall Assessment:**

Tushar Singh's resume demonstrates a strong academic background and relevant work experience in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. His skills align well with the requirements of the Viasat Control Systems Intern role, particularly in the areas of Python, Javascript, and Linux. However, there are some areas where he could improve his resume to better showcase his qualifications for this specific position.

**Strengths:**

* **Strong academic background:** Tushar is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics from Johns Hopkins University and holds a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Delhi Technological University. His coursework includes relevant topics such as data structures, computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.
* **Relevant work experience:** Tushar has experience as a Deep Learning and CV Research Assistant at ARCADE Lab - JHU, where he worked on projects involving 2D/3D registration, learning-based SLAM, and stress analysis. He also has experience as a Multi Agent Robotics Eng at Adani Defence and Aerospace, where he developed avionics systems for autonomous UAVs and won the IAF MAHAR BABA Competition.
* **Technical skills:** Tushar possesses a wide range of technical skills, including Python, C++, Matlab, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Verilog, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Intel Realsense tracking cameras, FPGA SoC, Ur5 Arm, Linux, ROS/ROS2, VS Code, GitHub, Gazebo, Rviz, AMD Xilinx Vitis, Jupyter, and SITL. These skills are highly relevant to the role of Viasat Control Systems Intern.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Lack of experience with Slack bots:** The job description specifically mentions the development of a Slack bot as a key responsibility. While Tushar has experience with Python and Javascript, he does not explicitly mention any experience with Slack bots or related technologies.
* **Limited experience with CI/CD:** The job description also mentions the use of Github Actions to automate CI/CD of the Slack bot. Tushar does not mention any experience with CI/CD tools or practices in his resume.
* **Lack of detail in work experience:** Tushar's work experience descriptions are brief and lack specific details about the projects he worked on and the technologies he used. Providing more detailed information would help the hiring manager better understand his contributions and accomplishments.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Highlight Slack bot experience:** If Tushar has any experience with Slack bots or related technologies, he should highlight it prominently in his resume. If he does not have direct experience, he could mention projects or coursework that demonstrate his ability to learn and apply new technologies quickly.
* **Demonstrate CI/CD knowledge:** Tushar could include a section in his resume that describes his understanding of CI/CD concepts and tools. He could also mention any experience he has with Github Actions or other CI/CD tools.
* **Provide more details in work experience:** Tushar should expand his work experience descriptions to include more specific information about the projects he worked on, the technologies he used, and the results he achieved. This will help the hiring manager better assess his skills and experience.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Tushar Singh's resume demonstrates a strong academic background and relevant work experience in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning. His skills align well with the requirements of the Viasat Control Systems Intern role. However, he could improve his resume by highlighting his experience with Slack bots, demonstrating his knowledge of CI/CD tools, and providing more details in his work experience descriptions. With these improvements, he would be a strong candidate for this position.","{""name"": ""Tushar Singh"", ""summary"": null, ""phone"": ""443-527-3061"", ""email"": ""tushar300101college@gmail.com"", ""media"": {""linkedin"": ""linkedin"", ""github"": ""github"", ""devpost"": null, ""medium"": null, ""leetcode"": null, ""dagshub"": null, ""kaggle"": null, ""instagram"": null}, ""education"": [{""degree"": ""Masters of Science Degree in ROBOTICS"", ""university"": ""JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY"", ""from"": ""Sep. 2023"", ""to"": ""May 2025(expected)"", ""grade"": null, ""coursework"": [""Data Structures"", ""Computer Vision"", ""Algorithm for sensor-based robotics"", ""Machine Learning"", ""Deep Learning"", ""Robot Kinematics and Dynamics"", ""Probability and Statistics"", ""Computer Architecture"", ""Robotics Sensors and Actuators""]}, {""degree"": ""Bachelors of Technology in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING"", ""university"": ""DELHI TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY"", ""from"": ""Aug. 2019"", ""to"": ""Jun. 2023"", ""grade"": null, ""coursework"": [""Data Structures"", ""Computer Vision"", ""Algorithm for sensor-based robotics"", ""Machine Learning"", ""Deep Learning"", ""Robot Kinematics and Dynamics"", ""Probability and Statistics"", ""Computer Architecture"", ""Robotics Sensors and Actuators""]}], ""skill_section"": [{""name"": ""Software"", ""skills"": [""Python"", ""C++"", ""Matlab"", ""Numpy"", ""Pandas"", ""TensorFlow"", ""Pytorch"", ""Verilog"", ""Ardupilot"", ""Dronekit"", ""Docker"", ""Scikit"", ""Learn"", ""Git"", ""Cmake"", ""Bash"", ""Matplotlib"", ""Multithreading""]}, {""name"": ""Hardware Systems"", ""skills"": [""Arduino"", ""Raspberry Pi"", ""Jetson Nano"", ""Intel Realsense tracking cameras"", ""FPGA SoC"", ""Ur5 Arm""]}, {""name"": ""Tools/OS/Frameworks"", ""skills"": [""Linux"", ""ROS/ROS2"", ""VS Code"", ""GitHub"", ""Gazebo"", ""Rviz"", ""AMD Xilinx Vitis"", ""Jupyter"", ""SITL""]}], ""work_experience"": ""[{\""role\"": \""Deep Learning and CV Research Assistant\"", \""company\"": \""ARCADE Lab - JHU\"", \""from\"": \""Oct. 2023\"", \""to\"": \""present\"", \""description\"": [\""Developed a non-conventional DNN to evaluate the accuracy of 2D/3D registration of X-rays and CT scans or DRRs in Minimal Invasive Surgery (MIS) to aid in complex surgical procedures with data generation and augmentation pipeline for model training.\"", \""Actively researching in learning-based SLAM for robotic sinus endoscopy by image segmentation, volumetric Rendering, and 6 DOF pose estimation, and utilizing the LLMs and multimodal diffusion models for synthetic data generation\"", \""Working on computer vision enabled stress analysis of surgeons during surgery by studying pupillometry.\""]}, {\""role\"": \""Multi Agent Robotics Eng\"", \""company\"": \""Adani Defence and Aerospace: Aerial Robotics\"", \""from\"": \""Sep. 2019\"", \""to\"": \""Feb. 2021\"", \""description\"": [\""Developed and integrated avionics systems for an autonomous swarm of UAVs used in disaster relief applications.\"", \""Co-developed a swarm control achieving collision avoidance and flocking using a weighted consensus-based algorithm, with a decentralized mesh communication architecture.\"", \""Won the IAF MAHAR BABA Competition; presented the solution at Aero India 2021 an international defense event.\""]}, {\""role\"": \""AI/ML Intern\"", \""company\"": \""Ericsson India Pvt.
